Node based Combat RPG
This is an application derived from an in-class activity. 
Originally, the activity was to create a node.js based application that pitted the user against a Zombie in a turn-based combat system. The chance-to-hit is based on RNG in guessing the same number that the app chooses.

v(0.1):
This application is now a turn-based RPG wherein the user has the ability to choose their desired name, and character class. This further involved the user and promotes personal investment in the game.
-Each character class has it's own specific weapon and damage type.
-random and simple encounter styles available.
-random encounters are significantly more complex. Involving a number of possible enemies to encounter, none of which are zombies.
-random encounters have the possibility to be much more difficult as the health pools are randomized and enemies have the possibility to have as much as 220HP.
-Starting and finishing display messages are unique to each type of character and monster encountered.

Upcoming v(0.1.1):
